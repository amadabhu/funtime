A bunch of little scripts I wrote in my free time
These scripts are from a bunch of leetcode or hackerrank or whatever problems I solved in my free time. They aren't designed to work together, just as a display of skillset. I didn't spend more than 20 minutes on each of these, so I'm aware there's lots of room for improvement.
